### What is a variable?

A variable allows us to store a unique name that acts as a named reference to a Ruby object. This allows us to refer to it more easily later.

### How do you assign a value or an expression to a variable?

Like this: `[variable name] = [value | expression]`

Ruby will evaluate the right side of the equation first before assigning it to a named variable on the left side.

### What does the += assignment operator do?

Shorthand for `[variable] = [variable] + [value | expression]`. It adds the result of the expression to the existing value that the variable points to. Then reassigns the result back to the variable.

### What does the -= assignment operator do?

Shorthand for `[variable] = [variable] - [value | expression]`.

### What does the \*= assignment operator do?

Shorthand for `[variable] = [variable] * [value | expression]`.

### What does the /= assignment operator do?

Shorthand for `[variable] = [variable] / [value \ expression]`.

### What are the variable naming conventions?

Variable names should always be `lowercase snake_case`
& descriptive / obvious as to what they contain.
