### What is a loop and why it is useful?

A loop allows us to repeat code a fixed number of times.

### What is a loop loop, and how would you use it?

A loop that runs until a `break` is encountered. Similar to `while(true)`.

### What is a while loop, and how would you use it?

A loop that runs whilst the evaluated `while` condition is `true`. Useful when you have an inderminate number of loops to run through. Cleaner than a loop because you define the logic at the start of the function (rather than a break within).

### What is a for loop, and how would you use it?

A loop that has a defined condition. Useful when you're iterating through a loop a fixed number of times.

### What is a #times loop, and how would you use it?

A loop that runs a specified number of times. E.g. If you need to run a block of code a specific number of times.

### What is an until loop, and how would you use it?

The inverse of a `while` loop, insofar that it continues to run while the evaluated condition is `false`.

### What are the #upto and #downto loops, and how would you use them?

If you need to do a loop from a _x_ to _y_ times either incrementing (`upto`) or decrementing (`downto`).
